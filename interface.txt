Character 0xFE is an escape character: the byte following it will be
sent to the LCD controller(s) (as determined by E line selection).

Character 0x7C is a second escape character (the "meta escape
character"). Commands after this byte change the behavior of the
sled's interface to the LCD. The command is a bitwise field, which
controls the backlight state and which LCD controllers (E1/E2) are
currently selected:

  b'xxxLLE21'

x: ignored
LL:
	0x ignored
	10 turn off backlight
	11 turn on backlight
E21:	0xx ignored
	101 use E1
	110 use E2
	111 use E1 and E2
